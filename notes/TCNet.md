# Paper Notes : TCNet

## 1. Intoduction

## 2. Literature Review

## 3. Problem Setup

There are 3 types of choice models :
- singular-choice model
- sequential choice model
- multiple-choice model

However singular-choice and multiple-choice model can be formalized as a special case of sequential choice model.

TODO : write mathematical formulations
